### Bank of Korea to cut rates by 25 bps on February 25 amid growth worries: Reuters poll [Link](https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/bank-of-korea-to-cut-rates-by-25-bps-on-february-25-amid-growth-worries-reuters-poll-3882361)

1. **Background**  
   - The Bank of Korea (BOK) is set to cut its key interest rate by 25 basis points to support a sluggish economy.  
   - The economy barely grew last quarter, prompting economists to predict further easing.  
   - Inflation is at 2.2%, close to the BOK's target of 2%, allowing for potential rate cuts.

2. **Key Events**  
   - Economists polled (February 14-20) overwhelmingly expect a 25 basis point cut to 2.75%.  
   - The BOK previously held rates steady due to domestic political instability affecting the currency.  
   - Economic growth projections have been downgraded to below the previously estimated 1.9% due to weak exports and consumer sentiment.

3. **Controversy/Reaction**  
   - The South Korean economy, reliant on semiconductor exports, faces risks from U.S. tariff threats.  
   - A majority of economists (32 of 35) predict a further cut to 2.50% in Q2 and potentially to 2.25% in Q3, despite the U.S. Federal Reserve's more cautious stance on rate cuts.  
   - There is division among economists regarding the timing of the next Fed rate cut, with most expecting it by mid-year.

4. **Conclusion**  
   - The BOK's decision to cut rates reflects a need to address a growing negative output gap and support economic growth amid external pressures.  
   - The outlook remains cautious, with expectations of additional cuts later in the year as the central bank navigates domestic and international challenges.

### Asia FX weak amid hawkish Fed outlook; Japan's strong CPI fuels rate hike bets [Link](https://www.investing.com/news/forex-news/asia-fx-weak-amid-hawkish-fed-outlook-japans-strong-cpi-fuels-rate-hike-bets-3882476)

1. **Background**  
   - Asian currencies declined amid hawkish comments from U.S. Federal Reserve officials and tariff threats from President Donald Trump.  
   - The U.S. Dollar Index rose by 0.1% during Asian hours.

2. **Key Events**  
   - Japan's core consumer prices increased by 3.2% in January, the highest in 19 months, contributing to an overall inflation rate of 4.0%.  
   - The Bank of Japan (BOJ) raised its short-term interest rate to 0.5% and may consider further hikes, potentially reaching 0.75% by Q3 2025.  
   - The Japanese yen strengthened to a 2.5-month high against the U.S. dollar, but adjusted by 0.4% on Friday after a 1.3% drop on Thursday.  
   - Japan's manufacturing activity shrank for the eighth consecutive month in February due to labor shortages and persistent inflation.  
   - Trump's announcement of tariffs on automobiles, semiconductors, and pharmaceuticals increased market caution.  
   - Fed Governor Adriana Kugler's comments supported delaying rate cuts due to persistent inflation.

3. **Controversy/Reaction**  
   - Trump's tariff plans created uncertainty, complicating the Fed's decision-making regarding rate cuts in 2025.  
   - Mixed reactions in Asian currencies: the Chinese yuan edged up 0.1%, while the Singapore dollar remained unchanged.  
   - The Indonesian rupiah and Australian dollar both rose by 0.1%, while the Indian rupee and South Korean won showed minimal movement ahead of the Bank of Korea's interest rate decision.

4. **Conclusion**  
   - The economic outlook remains uncertain due to inflationary pressures and geopolitical tensions, with expectations of further interest rate adjustments in Japan and potential rate cuts in the U.S. being influenced by external factors.
